## Welcome!
You've been invited for a basic screening with Carta Healthcare. We are super excited to have you!
___

The following exercises help us assess whether you will be a good technical fit for our team. As an early stage startup in healthcare, we are looking not only for talented engineers, but those who demonstrate good growth potential! 

These exercises are meant to be brief, whimsical, and fun. We ask that you do your best to treat them as such and avoid taking them too seriously. There is no penalization for not finishing an exercise nor are we looking to grade your performance. We'd rather see you enjoy the exercises and have fun while you're working on them :)

When your ready, **cd** into the **TravelingKnight** folder and read over the spec. This exercise should take between 20 and 30 minutes. When you feel happy with your work or that enough time has lapsed, **cd** into **BasicReactScaffold** and do the same. When you're all done we'll spend some time chatting about solutions and areas of optimization. Please also link us to your repository so we can review it later :)
